## OpenGL Scene Project

This project required us to pick a scene to recreate in OpenGL. This involved adapting the project to include more controls, designing the primitives, adding textures, material effects, lighting, etc.


## Project Features
### Keybinds
* W,A,S,D movement (Move camera forward, backward, left, right)
* Additional Q,E movement (Move camera straight up or down)
* Orthographic View angles: O, I, U (Front, Side, Top)
* Perspective Projection View: P
* Middle Mouse Button Scroll changes movement speed (up/down)
* Right Mouse Button Toggles Zoom. (RMB)
* Left Mouse Button Toggles FlashLight. (LMB)
* Console Output for controls/menu
* Utilized the following: OpenGL, GLEW, GLFW, and glm.
* Separated Logic and utilized OOP principles. 
* Will add documentation on final version.


## TODO:
 * Modify final material properties.
 * Add emissive for screen/bulb maybe. 


## Pictures During Progress

   
Shaders only, no textures:

## Requirements:
* GLEW
* GLFW
* glm

The include folder has everything required -- the project has not yet been updated to use that specific include folder, it's using folders from 2 directories out, the path needs to be changed for includes & linked libraries.
